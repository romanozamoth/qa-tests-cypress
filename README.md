# 🧪 QA Tests with Cypress

This repository contains automated test scripts using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), created as part of my learning process in QA automation.


The goal is to apply practical concepts from a QA course, gain hands-on experience with Cypress, and explore real-world testing scenarios.
